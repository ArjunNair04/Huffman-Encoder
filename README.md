# Text-Huffman-Encoding
# Huffman Encoding Project

This project provides an implementation of Huffman encoding, a lossless data compression algorithm. It includes a Python script that reads a text file, computes the frequency of each character, constructs a Huffman tree, and generates unique Huffman codes for each character based on their frequencies.

## Features
- Build a Huffman tree based on character frequencies within the text.
- Generate Huffman codes for efficient data representation.
- Calculate the total and average number of bits required for the Huffman-encoded data.
- Output the Huffman codes for each character in the text.

## Usage
To use this script,  place your text file in the same directory as the script and name it `huffmantext.txt`, or modify the script to read from your file of choice.

The script outputs:
- The total number of characters in the original text.
- The distinct number of characters in the original text.
- The total number of bits required for the Huffman-encoded text.
- The average number of bits per character.
